# simulations_plasmid_interactions

This is a repository for the data (includes R scripts, notebooks and raw data) underlying the paper "Plasmid Interactions Can Improve Plasmid Persistence in Bacterial Populations" available at https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.02033.

The directory "final_data" contains the script used to run the simulations and the output result tables. Note that the parameter/variable notations in the script and in the tables differ from those in manuscript.

The analysis of the output data was performed with the R notebook full_simulation_analysis.Rmd (also provided in html format). The analysis was performed with R version 4.0.2. Figures and supplementary tables are provided in the directory "analysis/figures_tables".
